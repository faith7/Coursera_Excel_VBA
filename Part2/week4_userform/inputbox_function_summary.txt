input box function vs input box

1) input function 
  - "" (cancel or ok) 
  - you can set the default value
   
In the following line of VBA code, y has been Dim'med as Variant:
y = InputBox("Enter number","Input",10)

The return value for the cancel button in this case is FALSE.

Incorrect. The return value for the cancel button using the input box function is "", 
assuming that the variable that the input box writes to is a Variant (or String).

2) input method (type) 
- type # 3 => number or string
- False=> cancel button
- "" -> ok button =>did not input anything

y = Application.InputBox(Prompt:="Enter number",Title:="Input",Type:=1)

The return value for the cancel button in this case is FALSE.

Correct 
The return value for the cancel button using the input box method is FALSE 
when y is Dim'med as Variant (or String or Boolean).
